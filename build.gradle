This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails and returns a cryptic message relating to a missing or incorrectly configured signing key.  Standard troubleshooting steps (like checking signing config) yield no results. The issue is subtly related to the use of a custom build system. In this case, a build.gradle file is customized for the Android project.
