# Expo Android Build Failure: Mysterious Signing Key Error

This repository demonstrates a rare bug encountered when building an Android APK using Expo CLI with a custom Android build system. The build process inexplicably fails, reporting a missing or incorrectly configured signing key despite the signing configuration being correctly set.

The problem is subtly linked to the interaction between Expo's build process and modifications to the `build.gradle` file.  Standard troubleshooting steps focusing on the signing configuration often fail to resolve the issue.

This repository provides both the problematic `build.gradle` file and a corrected version demonstrating the solution.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing `build.gradle` and `build.gradle.fixed`
3. Follow standard Expo instructions to build the Android APK (assuming your Expo project is already set up).  The build will fail using the original `build.gradle` file.
4. Replace the `build.gradle` with `build.gradle.fixed` and rebuild.  The build should now succeed.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that necessary signing configurations are correctly placed within the `build.gradle` file in sync with where Expo expects them.
